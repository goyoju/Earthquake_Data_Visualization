# Earthquake Data Visualization and Analysis

Growing up in California, earthquakes were a significant concern for me. Experiencing numerous quakes, I became acutely aware of nature's power. My time living in Korea also exposed me to earthquakes, reinforcing my understanding that these natural phenomena are not just localized but a global issue. The unpredictability and sheer force of earthquakes underscored their impact, driving my curiosity about their frequency and patterns globally.

This project will study the relationship between earthquakes and other factors, such as location or time, utilizing a dataset comprising records of 782 earthquakes from January 1, 1995, to January 1, 2023, sourced from Kaggle.

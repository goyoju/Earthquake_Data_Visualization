# Earthquake Data Visualization and Analysis
## by Junyoung Seo
Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/warcoder/earthquake-dataset)

Growing up in California, earthquakes were a significant concern for me. Experiencing numerous quakes, I became acutely aware of nature's power. My time living in Korea also exposed me to earthquakes, reinforcing my understanding that these natural phenomena are not just localized but a global issue. The unpredictability and sheer force of earthquakes underscored their impact, driving my curiosity about their frequency and patterns globally.

This project will study the relationship between earthquakes and other factors, such as location or time, utilizing a dataset comprising records of 782 earthquakes from January 1, 1995, to January 1, 2023, sourced from Kaggle.

The dataset includes

title: title name given to the earthquake
magnitude:: The magnitude of the earthquak
date_time: : date and ti
cdi: i: The maximum reported intensity for the event ra
mmi: mi: The maximum estimated instrumental intensity for the e
alert: ert: The alert level - “green”, “yellow”, “orange”, and
tsunami: nami: "1" for events in oceanic regions and "0" oth
sig: sig: A number describing how significant the event is. Larger numbers indicate a more significant event. This value is determined on a number of factors, including: magnitude, maximum MMI, felt reports, and estimated
net: t net: The ID of a data contributor. Identifies the network considered to be the preferred source of information for thi
nst: t. nst: The total number of seismic stations used to determine earthquake
dmin: n. dmin: Horizontal distance from the epicenter to the neare
gap: tion gap: The largest azimuthal gap between azimuthally adjacent stations (in degrees). In general, the smaller this number, the more reliable is the calculated horizontal position of the earthquake. Earthquake locations in which the azimuthal gap exceeds 180 degrees typically have large location and depth un
magType: s magType: The method or algorithm used to calculate the preferred magnitude f
depth: vent depth: The depth where the earthquake begi
latitude / longitude: / longitude: coordinate system by means of which the position or location of any place on Earth's surface can be determined
location: bed location: location wit
continent: try continent: continent of the earthq
country: ountry country: affected country
